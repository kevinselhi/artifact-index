## Medical and pharmaceutical artifacts show regulatory resilience

FDA regulatory submissions demonstrated remarkable stability through the pandemic, with some categories reaching record highs. **510(k) medical device clearances increased 10%** from pre-pandemic levels, while De Novo classification requests more than doubled.

| Artifact Type | Pre-Pandemic (2018-19 avg) | Post-Pandemic (2022-24 avg) | Trend | % Change | Confidence |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Clinical Trials Registered (ClinicalTrials.gov) | ~21,500/year | ~22,500/year | ↑ | +5% | HIGH |
| Novel Drug Approvals (CDER) | 53.5/year | 47.3/year | ↓ | -12% | HIGH |
| 510(k) Clearances | 2,960/year | 3,221/year | ↑ | +9% | HIGH |
| PMA Approvals | ~28/year | 30/year | → | +7% | HIGH |
| De Novo Classifications | ~18/year | 39/year | ↑ | +117% | HIGH |
| IND Applications | ~11,000/year | ~12,500/year | ↑ | +14% | MEDIUM |

The **De Novo pathway's 117% surge** reflects FDA's stricter interpretation of "intended use" requirements, forcing devices that previously qualified for 510(k) into the more rigorous De Novo process. Clinical trial registrations peaked in 2021 during COVID vaccine development but have since normalized to slightly above pre-pandemic levels.

## Conclusion: Structural shifts emerge from pandemic disruption

The data reveals three distinct patterns. **Regulatory-driven artifacts** (FDA submissions, patent filings, NEPA reviews) demonstrated remarkable stability, anchored by statutory requirements and institutional processes. **Transaction-linked artifacts** (commercial appraisals, Phase I ESAs, PMI projects) showed pronounced cyclicality, amplifying real estate and M&A market swings. **Digital transformation artifacts** (SOC 2 audits, cloud migrations, cybersecurity assessments) experienced structural step-changes, with volumes unlikely to return to pre-pandemic baselines.

The most striking findings include the **290% growth in SOC 2 audits**, **225% increase in cloud migration projects**, and **117% rise in FDA De Novo classifications**—all reflecting permanent shifts in how organizations operate, secure data, and bring products to market. Conversely, traditional artifacts like TV commercial production (-25%) and SPAC IPOs (95% decline from 2021 peak) face secular headwinds that extend beyond pandemic effects.

For researchers and practitioners working with the Human Artifact Index, these volume trends suggest recalibrating expectations: technology compliance artifacts warrant significantly higher weightings than pre-pandemic estimates, while traditional financial services artifacts may need downward adjustment from historical norms.
