# The 2020 Human Artifact Index – Scoping, Framework, and Initial Cut

This project is feasible but large enough that it must be built iteratively. Below is a structured framework, proposed methodology, and a first, defensible partial index rather than a fabricated “complete” 100‑row table with invented 2020 prices. Where data are weak, that is flagged explicitly.

The rest of this answer is organized so you can (a) critique the structure, and (b) decide whether to proceed in staged extensions (e.g., 20 → 50 → 100 artifact types) with deeper web‑based evidence collection per artifact.

***

## 1. Executive Summary

The 2020 Human Artifact Index aims to rank 100 distinct professional B2B artifact types, by typical economic value per instance in 2020, across finance, legal, medical/pharma, consulting, engineering/architecture, technology, real estate, environmental/regulatory, and scientific/R\&D.

Key points:

- A rigorous, *fully sourced* 100‑artifact index for a single year (2020) does not exist in any public dataset; pricing is scattered across sector‑specific reports, association guidance, trade articles, and fee studies.
- Many high‑value artifacts are not sold at a flat per‑deliverable fee but are embedded in:
    - Percentage‑of‑deal fees (e.g., M\&A sell‑side mandates, fairness opinions).
    - Percentage of construction cost (architecture/engineering design).[^1][^2][^3]
    - Larger project budgets (e.g., clinical trials, custom software programs).[^4][^5][^6]
- COVID‑19 in 2020 altered:
    - **Volume and mix** (e.g., surge in restructuring/bankruptcy work, clinical research delays and protocol amendments, acceleration in digital transformation).
    - **Delivery model** (rapid shift to remote / virtual, which affected staffing and margins more than list pricing in many cases).
- A realistic research product must:
    - Surface explicit fee benchmarks where available.
    - Back‑solve artifact value from total project or percentage‑of‑X structures when that is how 2020 fees were actually set.
    - Be honest about confidence levels and about where numbers are cautiously extrapolated from proximate years.

This answer therefore:

- Lays out a **methodology** for constructing the Index.
- Proposes a **taxonomy of artifact types** and sectors.
- Provides a **sample ranked table for 20 high‑value artifacts** with approximate 2020‑era ranges, using current fee literature that still reflects pre‑AI / pre‑inflation fee structures, or explicitly cites 2020 reports where available.
- Gives **full profile write‑ups** for 10 exemplar artifact types to show the level of detail and sourcing that can realistically be achieved.
- Outlines how to scale to 100 artifacts with more intensive, source‑by‑source work.

If you want to proceed, the next step is to lock the taxonomy and then expand each sector to its target artifact count, with systematic web scraping and cross‑checking.

***

## 2. Methodology Explanation

### 2.1 Research approach and source selection

Sources are necessarily fragmented and sector‑specific:

- **Professional and trade reports**:
    - Legal and consulting: law firm benchmarking reports, legal finance studies, and consulting services market overviews.[^7][^8][^9][^10]
    - Architecture/engineering: AIA guidance and industry discussions on % of construction cost.[^11][^2][^3][^12][^13][^14][^1]
    - Cybersecurity/IT: security assessment pricing guides, vendor whitepapers.[^15][^16][^17][^18][^19]
- **Fee and cost benchmarks**:
    - M\&A advisory fee guides and deal‑size tables.[^20][^21][^22][^23]
    - Clinical trial costs and CRO pricing breakdowns.[^24][^5][^25][^26][^4]
    - Custom software development cost benchmarks.[^27][^6][^28][^29][^30][^31][^32]
- **Professional commentary with price ranges**:
    - Reddit and practitioner Q\&As on due diligence, architect fees, etc. (used only as secondary corroboration).[^33][^2]

Temporal alignment to 2020:

- Many pricing structures in these sectors are **slow‑moving**, with modest annual inflation and fairly stable percentage‑based norms. For such artifacts, 2022–2025 fee studies can often reasonably reflect 2020 *structures*, but absolute 2020 values must be adjusted or treated as indicative only.
- Where a 2020‑specific report exists (e.g., a 2020 legal finance report, 2019/2020 law firm benchmarks), those are prioritized.[^10][^7]


### 2.2 Identifying and categorizing artifacts

Definition used:

- An artifact type is a **discrete, externally billable professional deliverable**, usually:
    - A report, protocol, plan, design, or submission.
    - Produced by a specialist team.
    - Commissioned for a specific deal, project, or regulatory purpose.

Steps:

1. Enumerate candidate artifacts by sector using:
    - Your sector list plus common high‑value deliverables found in fee literature.
2. Exclude:
    - Pure services without a clear final deliverable (e.g., generic “management coaching”).
    - Internal documents with no external billing.
    - Physical products and consumer services.
3. Consolidate overly granular items where needed:
    - E.g., group “Phase II oncology clinical trial protocol” under “Phase II clinical trial protocol \& execution design”.

### 2.3 Valuation methodology and ranking criteria

- **Primary value metric**: typical *project‑level economic value* or *fee* per artifact instance in 2020.
- **Ranking**:
    - Use midpoint of credible fee or value ranges (or best estimate) to position artifacts.
    - Where fees are percentage‑based, approximate a typical underlying base (e.g., a median mid‑market deal size or construction budget) using 2019–2021 deal size distributions and case examples, then derive a representative artifact value.[^21][^22][^2][^12][^20][^1]
- **COVID‑19 adjustments**:
    - Note 2020‑specific volume or pricing changes qualitatively for each artifact, rather than trying to mathematically adjust every fee.

Confidence levels:

- **High**:
    - Well‑documented bands (e.g., cyber risk assessments, software project cost ranges, clinical trial phase costs).[^5][^26][^6][^16][^28][^17][^29][^18][^31][^32][^4][^27][^15]
- **Medium**:
    - Percentage‑based fees anchored to typical project sizes (M\&A advisory, architectural design for common building types).[^2][^3][^12][^13][^14][^20][^21][^1][^11]
- **Low**:
    - Niche legal or regulatory artifacts where only anecdotal price references exist.

Limitations:

- No single data source lists per‑deliverable pricing for 2020 across all sectors; synthesis and interpretation are necessary.
- For deal‑linked and construction‑linked artifacts, “value per artifact” is somewhat artificial: the client pays for the bundle; this index isolates the *core work product* most aligned with the payment.

## 3. Proposed Sector Taxonomy and Target Artifact Counts

A realistic breakdown for 100 artifacts might be:


| Sector | Target \# of Artifact Types |
| :-- | :-- |
| Financial services \& PE/VC | 18–20 |
| Legal \& dispute resolution | 18–20 |
| Medical \& pharmaceutical | 12–15 |
| Management consulting | 12–15 |

## 5. Detailed Artifact Profiles (10 Exemplars)

### 1. Phase III Clinical Trial Protocol \& Execution Plan

- **Description**
A Phase III trial protocol and operational execution plan specify the design, endpoints, statistical analysis, patient population, sites, and operational procedures for large, pivotal clinical studies intended to support regulatory approval. The “artifact” here is the integrated protocol plus full operationalization package as provided by sponsor and CRO teams, culminating in trial execution.
- **Economic Value (2020)**
    - Typical total cost per Phase III trial in the US and EU spans from roughly 20M to over 100M USD depending on indication, sample size, and complexity.[^26][^4][^5]
    - Benchmarks for sponsor spend per Phase III trial around 52–100M are widely cited across therapeutic areas.[^4][^5][^26]
    - COVID‑19 in 2020 caused numerous delays, site shutdowns, and protocol changes, often increasing per‑trial costs due to extended duration and remote adaptations.[^25][^26]
    - Confidence: **High** for total trial cost ranges; lower for isolating the value of the “protocol/design artifact” separate from operations.
- **Producer Teams**
    - Global pharma and large biotech sponsors.
    - Contract Research Organizations (CROs) performing protocol design input, site selection, monitoring, data management, and regulatory documentation.[^26][^4]
    - Roles: clinical project leads, biostatisticians, medical monitors, CRAs, data managers, regulatory specialists.
- **Client Context**
    - Commissioned by pharma/biotech companies seeking pivotal efficacy and safety data for NDA/BLA submissions (FDA, EMA).
    - Triggered by transition from Phase II proof‑of‑concept to confirmatory development, often with substantial capital at stake.
    - Therapeutic areas with large markets (oncology, cardiology, autoimmune) dominate.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Pivotal Phase III trials for COVID‑19 vaccines begun in 2020 involved tens of thousands of patients and budgets easily exceeding 100M USD per program, when factoring rapid enrollment, global site footprints, and intensive monitoring, though detailed line‑item budgets are proprietary.[^25][^26]
    - Non‑COVID oncology Phase III programs referenced in clinical cost studies show median costs in the tens of millions.[^5][^4][^26]
- **2020 Notes**
    - Massive operational disruption: site closures, remote monitoring, protocol amendments, and prioritization of COVID‑19‑related research.[^25][^26]
    - Non‑COVID trials often paused or slowed, pushing up overhead per completed trial but not necessarily contractual fee rates.
    - Regulatory agencies issued guidance enabling remote consent and virtual visits, changing the nature of protocol artifacts.
- **Sources**:[^4][^5][^26][^25]

***

### 2. Phase II Clinical Trial Protocol \& Execution Plan

- **Description**
Phase II protocols test efficacy and dose while continuing safety assessment, usually in several hundred patients. The artifact encompasses protocol design, statistical plan, site network, CRFs, and operational planning.
- **Economic Value (2020)**
    - Typical Phase II trial costs are commonly benchmarked around 7–20M USD.[^5][^26][^4]
    - Per‑patient costs are higher than Phase III but with smaller N; total budgets are lower.[^26][^4][^5]
    - COVID‑19 disruptions in 2020 led to delays, increased monitoring costs, and remote adaptations, similar to Phase III.[^25]
    - Confidence: **High** for total trial cost ranges.
- **Producer Teams**
    - Same as Phase III but often with more intense protocol design iteration.
    - Sponsored by mid‑size biotechs and pharma, frequently outsourced to CROs.
- **Client Context**
    - Triggered after promising Phase I safety data.
    - Particularly important for venture‑backed biotechs using Phase II data to justify large follow‑on financings or partnerships.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Numerous oncology and rare disease Phase II programs in 2020, often cited with total trial budgets of 10–20M in industry cost guides.[^4][^5][^26]
- **2020 Notes**
    - More cancellations and deferrals than Phase III, as sponsors reallocated capital or delayed mid‑risk programs.
    - Remote data capture and virtual visits increased, affecting trial management artifacts.
- **Sources**:[^5][^26][^4][^25]

***

### 3. Large‑Cap Sell‑Side M\&A Advisory Mandate

- **Description**
A sell‑side M\&A mandate in the 1B+ deal range includes strategic positioning, buyer outreach, valuation, running a structured process, and producing core artifacts (confidential information memorandum, management presentation deck, process letters, and ultimately an advisory “deal book”). The artifact for purposes of this index is the integrated advisory “deal execution package”.
- **Economic Value (2020)**
    - For deals above 100M, typical sell‑side advisory fees range from 1–2% of deal value.[^22][^23][^20][^21]
    - On a 1B transaction this implies 10–20M USD in advisory fees.
    - Middle‑market fee guides show similar tiers with clear banding across sizes and geographies, consistent with 2019–2021 practices.[^23][^20][^21][^22]
    - COVID‑19 caused a sharp but temporary drop in M\&A volume in early 2020, followed by a late‑2020 rebound in some sectors; fee structures largely persisted though competition could pressure rates.[^22][^23]
    - Confidence: **High** on fee % bands; **medium** on “typical” deal size used as base (1B is a stylized large‑cap example).
- **Producer Teams**
    - Bulge‑bracket and elite boutique investment banks.
    - Deal teams: MDs/partners, VPs/associates, analysts, industry and product specialists.
- **Client Context**
    - Commissioned by large corporates, PE portfolio companies, or conglomerates.
    - Triggered by strategic exits, carve‑outs, or PE sponsor sales.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Numerous 1B+ deals announced in 2020, particularly in tech and healthcare, though specific fee amounts are usually undisclosed. Industry fee guides indicate the above ranges are standard.[^20][^21][^23][^22]
- **2020 Notes**
    - Market uncertainty in Q2 2020 froze many processes; valuations and risk pricing changed, but contract fee formulas (success‑based %) remained structurally similar.
    - Virtual due diligence rooms and remote management presentations became standard.
- **Sources**:[^21][^23][^20][^22]

***

### 4. Upper Mid‑Market Sell‑Side M\&A Advisory Mandate (25–500M Deals)

- **Description**
Similar work product as large‑cap M\&A but for mid‑market companies; key artifacts are CIMs, models, process documentation, and negotiation support.
- **Economic Value (2020)**
    - For 25–100M deals, M\&A fee guides indicate 3–5% of deal value; for 100–500M, 1–2% is common.[^23][^20][^21][^22]
    - Example: 60M deal at 4% yields ~2.4M in fees; 250M deal at 1–2% yields 2.5–5M.[^21]
    - Additional retainers and work fees may apply, typically 10–50k/month, credited to success fees.[^20][^22][^23][^21]
    - Confidence: **High** on ranges; **medium** on picking specific tie‑break values.
- **Producer Teams**
    - Mid‑market investment banks, Big 4 corporate finance teams, and regional boutiques.
    - Similar mix of bankers and analysts, often smaller teams.
- **Client Context**
    - Private, founder‑owned, or PE‑owned mid‑market companies.
    - COVID‑19 increased distressed sales and sector consolidation in 2020, particularly in travel, retail, and energy.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Industry fee studies show numerous mid‑market transactions with fees in the 1–5M range for mandates in this band.[^22][^20][^21]
- **2020 Notes**
    - Overall mid‑market M\&A volume dipped sharply in early 2020, but restructuring‑linked sales and PE‑backed buy‑and‑build created pockets of activity.
    - Remote buyer meetings and diligence substantially changed process logistics.
- **Sources**:[^23][^20][^21][^22]

    - Typically tied to funded capital programs and multi‑year planning.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Large US transportation and water projects often report design costs in public procurement documents at low‑single‑digit to high‑single‑digit percentages of project budgets.[^1][^2][^12]
- **2020 Notes**
    - COVID‑19 affected on‑site surveys and stakeholder engagement; design work shifted more strongly to remote collaboration tools.
    - Some infrastructure programs were delayed; others were accelerated as counter‑cyclical stimulus, with design contracts signed in late 2020 for later construction.
- **Sources**:[^13][^14][^11][^2][^3][^12][^1]

***

### 6. High‑End Hospital / Complex Facility Architecture Package

    - Phase I trials often cost in the range of 1–5M USD.[^26][^4][^5]
    - Per‑patient cost is high but with small numbers; total budgets lower than later phases.
    - Confidence: **High**.
- **Producer Teams**
    - Early‑stage biotechs and pharma, often working with specialist Phase I units and CROs.
- **Client Context**
    - Commissioned when moving from preclinical to human studies; essential for any drug development program.
- **Real‑World Examples**
    - Numerous oncology and specialty drug Phase I programs with budgets in this range are cited in cost analyses.[^4][^5][^26]
- **2020 Notes**
    - COVID‑19 caused delays in non‑COVID early‑stage programs, but also a rapid expansion of vaccine and antiviral Phase I trials.
    - Health system constraints influenced recruitment and site capacity.
- **Sources**:[^5][^26][^4]

The same template would be applied for the remaining 90 artifacts: corporate strategy reviews, commercial due diligence, restructuring plans, litigation expert reports, major regulatory submissions (e.g., NDAs, PMAs), IPO prospectuses and registration statements, environmental and sustainability reports, real estate appraisal packages, grant proposals for large federal programs, etc.

## 6. Sector Analysis (High‑Level from Sample)

Even from this partial sample:

- **Medical/Pharma**: Individual artifacts (Phase II/III trial designs \& execution) dominate top end of value, with per‑artifact spend routinely 7–100M+. These are capital‑intensive, regulated, and long‑duration.
- **Financial Services**: Large M\&A mandates and restructuring packages can rival Phase II/III trials in fee size for very large deals, but the distribution is more skewed (many smaller deals).
- **Engineering \& Architecture**: Design packages for mega‑projects and complex facilities feature in the multi‑million‑dollar range, linked tightly to underlying capex.
- **Technology \& Cyber**: Individual platform builds and security programs sit in the 100k–multi‑million band; they are numerous but per‑artifact value is usually below mega‑deals and mega‑trials.
- **Management Consulting**: Strategy and digital roadmaps typically sit in the mid six‑ to low seven‑figure range for large corporates.

A full Index would tabulate aggregate sector value (sum of artifact midpoint × estimated 2020 volume) to show which sectors generated the most economic value through discrete artifacts, then compare that to artifact counts.

## 7. 2020 Market Context (Cross‑Cutting)

Cross‑sector COVID‑19 themes relevant to artifacts:

- **Shock and re‑prioritization (Q1–Q2 2020)**
    - Freeze or delay of discretionary strategy projects and some IT builds.
    - Surge in **restructuring, bankruptcy, and distressed M\&A** artifacts as liquidity crises hit certain sectors.
    - Regulatory and relief program artifacts (e.g., PPP loan support documentation) emerged but tend to be lower per‑artifact value.
- **Remote delivery normalization**
    - Almost all artifact creation shifted to fully remote teams, accelerating adoption of collaboration tools; this had limited immediate impact on contract values but changed operating models.
- **Health and clinical research**
    - COVID‑19‑related clinical work absorbed capacity and funding; non‑COVID trials often slowed, raising per‑trial overhead.
    - Health facility design work (e.g., ICUs, labs) saw increased urgency.
- **Digital acceleration**
    - Sharp increase in demand for cloud migration strategies, cybersecurity assessments, and e‑commerce implementations, boosting volumes of those artifacts.

## 8. Insights and Patterns

From the methodological and sample view:

- **Regulatory and capital‑linked artifacts dominate the top of the value distribution**
    - Items whose failure would prevent a billion‑dollar transaction or multi‑hundred‑million‑dollar capex (e.g., Phase III protocols, huge M\&A CIM/processes, major infrastructure designs) have the highest per‑instance economic value.
- **Complexity and regulatory scrutiny correlate strongly with artifact value**
    - Highly regulated sectors (pharma, financial markets, critical infrastructure) require dense, audited artifacts that justify high fees.
- **Percentage‑of‑X pricing is common at the top end**
    - Architecture as a percentage of construction cost; M\&A fees as a % of deal value; some investment and regulatory artifacts priced as % of funds raised or capital deployed.[^12][^13][^14][^1][^11][^2][^3][^20][^21][^22][^23]
- **Time‑to‑produce vs value**
    - Some extremely valuable artifacts (e.g., fairness opinions) can be produced in weeks but command high fees due to risk and liability. Others (trial protocols, major design packages) require years of effort. Time invested is not linearly correlated with economic value; risk and consequentiality matter more.
- **Advisory vs compliance**
    - Compliance/approval artifacts (trial protocols, EIS, regulatory submissions) tend to be less discretionary and sustain pricing in downturns.
    - Advisory artifacts (strategy reviews, transformation blueprints) are more cyclical but can command high prices when tied to major capital decisions.

## 9. Next Steps to Complete the Full 100‑Artifact Index

To transform this into the definitive reference you want:

1. **Lock the taxonomy and ranking logic**
    - Confirm sector allocations and ranking based on midpoint economic value with frequency as secondary tie‑breaker.
2. **Build a structured artifact list**
    - Enumerate 100 artifacts, with preliminary rank and sector tags.
3. **Deep dive per artifact (2–3 sources minimum)**
    - For each, pull explicit 2018–2021 fee references or cost benchmarks and annotate confidence levels.
    - Where needed, estimate 2020 values by adjusting later fee studies back to 2020 using sector CPI or wage indices (with transparent notation).
4. **Add detailed 2020‑specific notes**
    - Use 2020 annual reports, sector COVID impact studies, and trade coverage to characterize volume and price movements for each artifact type.
5. **Produce final tables and profiles**
    - Full 100‑row ranked table.
    - 100 detailed profiles in the format used above.
    - Sector‑level aggregate analyses (counts × value × volume) and narrative of COVID‑19 impacts.

If you’d like, the next iteration can:

- Propose a concrete list of all 100 artifact names (without full profiles yet) so you can edit it.
- Then expand them in batches (e.g., 20 at a time) with sourced 2020 value ranges and detailed write‑ups.
