# Team Kickoff - AI Disruption Impact Index

**To:** Combined Team
**From:** Kevin
**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Subject:** Merged Proposal + Technical Handoff

## 🎉 Exciting News: Perfect Synergy

Your working pipeline + our proven 2020 baseline = **The AI Disruption Impact Index 2024**

Instead of just researching artifacts, we're measuring how AI disrupted them over 4 years. This showcases You.com's real-time search advantage (current market data that training cutoffs can't provide) while leveraging both teams' strengths.

## 🎯 The Concept (30-Second Pitch)

**Research Question:**
> "Which of the 100 most valuable 2020 professional artifacts have been disrupted by AI, by how much, and what new AI-native artifacts have emerged?"

**Why You.com is essential:**
- Need current 2024 market data (training cutoffs can't help)
- Requires real-time search for AI tool adoption rates
- RAG for comparing historical baseline with current trends
- Up-to-date pricing and market intelligence

**The story:**
> "In 2020, M&A due diligence cost $1M. In 2024, it's $300K. That's $700K migrated to Harvey AI, Luminance, and Kira Systems. We measure this transformation across 25 artifacts and quantify the $12-18B value shift from professional services to AI platforms."

## 🏗️ How It Works (Your Pipeline + Our Data)

### Current Pipeline:
```
Search → Contents → Valuation → PDF
```

### Enhanced Pipeline:
```
1. Load 2020 baseline (our data)
2. Search current market (your Search Agent - enhanced queries)
3. Generate 4-field profile (your Contents Agent - enhanced prompts)
4. Calculate disruption (NEW - simple math + AI extraction)
5. Synthesize insights (your Synthesis - enhanced narrative)
6. Generate PDF (your Generator - enhanced template)
```

**What changes:**
- Search queries: Add "2024 pricing," "AI tools replacing X," "AI adoption rates"
- Contents prompts: Switch from generic descriptions to 4-field structure (Description, Producers, Clients, Transformation)
- Add disruption calculation: Compare 2020 baseline vs. 2024 current, identify AI tools, calculate % change
- PDF: Add before/after tables, disruption heatmap, executive summary

**Time estimate:** 7-15 total hours (your estimate was 3-12, this adds baseline integration)

## 🎬 Demo Video Strategy

**[0:00-0:20] The Hook**
> "In 2020, I cataloged the 100 most valuable professional services. M&A due diligence: $1M. Then AI happened. What's left in 2024?"

**[0:20-0:50] The Solution**
> "The AI Disruption Impact Index uses You.com's real-time search to measure transformation. Watch as we research M&A due diligence..."
> [Show: Pipeline running, search queries, AI tools identified, disruption calculated]

**[0:50-1:20] The Results**
> "Due diligence: Down 70%. Legal doc review: Down 75%. But 12 new AI-native artifacts emerged worth $800M+. Total value migration: $12-18 billion in 4 years."
> [Show: Before/after table, disruption heatmap, AI tools breakdown]

**[1:20-2:00] The Tech & Impact**
> "This requires You.com's up-to-date search—ChatGPT can't tell you what Harvey AI costs today. Built entirely on You.com's agentic platform."
