# THE 2020 HUMAN ARTIFACT INDEX

## A Definitive Ranked Catalog of the 100 Most Economically Valuable Professional Artifact Types Produced in Calendar Year 2020

---

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Overview of Research Methodology

This comprehensive research report identifies, values, and ranks the 100 highest-value professional artifact types produced in calendar year 2020. The research synthesizes data from industry reports, professional service firm publications, regulatory filings, academic research, and market research firms to create a definitive historical baseline of high-value professional deliverables across industries.

The methodology employed:
- Web-based research across authoritative industry sources
- Cross-referencing of pricing data from multiple sources
- Analysis of 2020-specific market conditions including COVID-19 pandemic impacts
- Ranking by typical economic value per artifact instance (using midpoint values)
- Comprehensive coverage across 11+ professional service sectors

## Key Findings and Insights

1. **Financial Services Dominance**: M&A advisory, investment banking deliverables, and complex financial restructuring artifacts command the highest individual values, with mega-deal advisory fees reaching $50-120M+ per engagement.

2. **Healthcare/Pharma Premium**: Clinical trial protocols and FDA regulatory submissions represent extraordinarily high-value artifacts, with Phase III clinical trials costing $20-50M+ and complete drug development exceeding $2.6 billion.

3. **Legal Services Breadth**: Patent litigation, complex corporate transactions, and regulatory matters generated significant artifact values ranging from $100K to $4M+ per engagement.

4. **Technology Acceleration**: Enterprise software implementations (ERP, cloud migration) and cybersecurity assessments saw increased demand during 2020 due to rapid digital transformation needs.

5. **COVID-19 Bifurcation**: The pandemic created a clear split between artifacts that saw increased demand (restructuring, digital transformation, regulatory compliance) and those that declined (traditional M&A, commercial real estate).

## Value Distribution Across Sectors

| Sector | Share of Top 100 | Typical Value Range |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Financial Services | 22% | $200K - $120M+ |
| Medical/Pharmaceutical | 15% | $30K - $50M+ |
| Legal Services | 18% | $10K - $4M+ |
| Management Consulting | 12% | $150K - $5M+ |
| Engineering/Technology | 14% | $50K - $10M+ |
| Architecture/Construction | 6% | $50K - $2M+ |
| Creative/Marketing | 5% | $20K - $500K+ |
| Environmental/Regulatory | 5% | $50K - $2M+ |
| Other | 3% | Varies |

## 2020-Specific Trends and COVID-19 Impacts

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped the professional services landscape in 2020:

- **Market Contraction**: Global consulting could have lost approximately $30 billion in value, with the industry potentially shrinking 19% from $160B to $130B
- **Countercyclical Services Surge**: Restructuring, bankruptcy advisory, and litigation services saw increased demand
- **Digital Acceleration**: Cloud migration projects, cybersecurity assessments, and remote work enablement artifacts experienced unprecedented demand
- **Delayed Transactions**: Traditional M&A activity declined significantly in Q2-Q3 2020 before recovering
- **Remote Delivery**: Professional services firms rapidly adapted to virtual delivery models

# 2. METHODOLOGY EXPLANATION

## Research Approach and Source Selection

This research employed a multi-layered approach:

1. **Primary Research Databases**: Professional service firm publications (McKinsey, BCG, Bain, Big 4, AmLaw 100), industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester, IBISWorld), and regulatory filings (SEC EDGAR, FDA databases)

2. **Professional Association Sources**: American Bar Association, American Medical Association, IEEE, AICPA, Casualty Actuarial Society, and industry-specific professional bodies

3. **Market Research**: Trade publications, academic journals on professional services pricing, and specialized B2B market research

4. **Regulatory Sources**: Federal Register notices, USPTO fee schedules, FDA MDUFA fee tables, SEC filing fee schedules

## How Artifacts Were Identified and Categorized

Artifacts were identified through:
- Industry standard terminology and professional nomenclature
- Distinct deliverable boundaries (not too granular, not too broad)
- Clear producer-client relationships with measurable billing values
- Active production during calendar year 2020

Categorization criteria:
- Must be a professional B2B or institutional deliverable
- Created by teams with specialized expertise
- Have measurable economic value/billing amount
- Represent a complete, discrete work product

## Valuation Methodology and Ranking Criteria

**Primary Ranking Metric**: Typical economic value per artifact instance
- Used midpoint of stated ranges when exact values unavailable
- Weighted toward documented market rates over theoretical estimates
- Considered both direct billing and total economic value to client
- Frequency of production used as tiebreaker for similar values

**Value Estimation Process**:
1. Identify documented fee ranges from authoritative sources
2. Cross-reference with multiple sources when available
3. Adjust for 2020 market conditions where applicable
4. Apply professional judgment for data gaps

## Limitations and Confidence Levels

**High Confidence** (multiple corroborating sources): M&A advisory fees, audit fees, clinical trial costs, standard legal fees, consulting engagement costs

**Medium Confidence** (limited but reliable sources): Specialized consulting engagements, niche technical services, emerging technology implementations

**Low Confidence** (estimates based on limited data): Highly customized deliverables, proprietary corporate work products, emerging service categories

**Key Limitations**:
- 2020-specific pricing data sometimes unavailable; proxied from adjacent years
- Private transaction data not publicly disclosed
- Geographic variation in pricing not fully captured
- COVID-19 created significant volatility in some categories

## Definition Refinements and Edge Cases

**Included**: Professional deliverables with clear client billing, discrete completion milestones, and measurable value exchange

**Excluded**: Internal corporate documents, ongoing service arrangements without discrete deliverables, consumer-facing products, physical manufactured goods

**Edge Cases Resolved**:
- Large-scale implementations treated as single artifacts when contracted as unified projects
- Multi-phase engagements counted at total engagement value
- Retainer arrangements excluded unless producing discrete deliverables

# 7. INSIGHTS AND PATTERNS

## Common Characteristics of Highest-Value Artifacts

The top 25 artifacts share several distinguishing characteristics:

### 1. Regulatory/Legal Requirement
Many high-value artifacts exist because of regulatory mandates:
- FDA submissions (NDA, PMA, 510k) - required for market access
- SEC filings (S-1, proxy statements) - required for public companies
- Environmental impact statements - required for federal permits
- Annual audits - required for public companies

### 2. High Stakes Outcomes
Value correlates with potential client impact:
- M&A advisory: Multi-billion dollar transactions
- Clinical trials: Drug approval worth hundreds of millions
- Restructuring: Company survival at stake
- IPO: Transformational corporate milestone

### 3. Specialized Expertise Requirements
Top artifacts require deep specialized knowledge:
- Pharmaceutical: Combined medical, scientific, regulatory expertise
- Investment banking: Financial modeling, deal structuring, market knowledge
- Patent litigation: Technical subject matter + legal expertise
- Infrastructure: Engineering credentials and certifications

### 4. Time Pressure and Execution Risk
Many high-value artifacts involve significant execution risk:
- Transaction advisory: Deal timelines and competitive dynamics

|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| Pricing Power | Limited by market rates | Higher pricing flexibility |
| Value Driver | Necessity/requirement | Perceived strategic value |
| Differentiation | Quality and reliability | Expertise and insight |
| Client Relationship | Vendor | Trusted advisor |
| Examples | Audits, FDA submissions, compliance reviews | Strategy consulting, M&A advisory, transformation |

## Time-to-Produce Correlations with Value

**Long Duration, High Value**
- Phase III clinical trials: 2-4 years, $20-50M
- EIS preparation: 3-5 years average, $1-85M
- Major ERP implementation: 1-2 years, $5-10M+

**Short Duration, High Value**
- Fairness opinions: 2-4 weeks, $200K-2M
- Quality of earnings: 3-6 weeks, $50-150K
- M&A advisory (deal execution): 3-6 months, $1-120M

**Time Premium**
Expedited timelines command 50-200% premiums in many categories, particularly:
- Regulatory submissions
- Transaction advisory
- Crisis management

## Other Notable Patterns

### Team Size and Composition
High-value artifacts typically require:
- Senior expert involvement (partners, principals, MDs)
- Multi-disciplinary teams
- External specialist support
- Quality assurance/review processes

### Geographic Premium
2020 pricing data shows significant geographic variation:
- NYC/SF premium: 25-50% over national average
- DC premium for regulatory work: 20-40%
- International deals: Currency and complexity premiums

### Client Size Premium
Larger clients tend to pay higher fees:
- Brand/reputation value of working with major firms
- Greater complexity of larger enterprises
