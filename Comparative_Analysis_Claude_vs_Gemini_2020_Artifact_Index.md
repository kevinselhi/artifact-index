# Comparative Analysis: Claude Code vs. Gemini Deep Research
## The 2020 Human Artifact Index - Methodology & Results Comparison

**Analysis Date:** October 24, 2025
**Comparing:** Claude Code WebSearch Research vs. Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research

---

## Executive Summary

Both research approaches successfully created comprehensive indices of professional artifacts from 2020, but with **fundamentally different valuation philosophies** that led to dramatically different rankings:

- **Gemini Deep Research** adopted a **total production cost** approach, valuing artifacts by their fully-loaded creation cost including all R&D and labor
- **Claude WebSearch** used a **professional services billing** approach, focusing on discrete engagement fees and project costs

### Key Divergence:
- **Gemini's #1:** New Drug Application ($100M-$500M+) - total R&D capitalization
- **Claude's #1:** Phase 3 Clinical Trial ($15M-$30M) - discrete project execution cost

**Both approaches are valid** but answer slightly different questions:
- Gemini: "What did it COST to create this artifact?"
- Claude: "What would you PAY for this artifact as a service?"

## 1. Methodology Comparison

### Research Process

| Dimension | Claude WebSearch | Gemini Deep Research |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Method** | Parallel web searches across sectors | Comprehensive deep research synthesis |
| **Search Depth** | 15+ targeted searches with immediate results | Unknown depth (black box), likely extensive |
| **Time Investment** | ~30 minutes of active searching | Unknown (delegated task) |
| **Data Sources** | Industry reports, GSA schedules, professional associations | Industry reports, court filings, corporate publications |
| **2020 Specificity** | Mixed - often used 2019-2021 proxy data | Mixed - explicitly noted data scarcity protocol |
| **Transparency** | Fully transparent search process | Less transparent (delegated synthesis) |

### Valuation Philosophy - THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE

**Gemini Deep Research:**
> "Economic Value was defined as either the typical B2B billing amount or the **fully-loaded cost to produce the artifact** (e.g., for internal R&D artifacts like an NDA, which aren't 'billed' but have a massive production cost)."

**Claude WebSearch:**
> Focused on "typical billing range or project value" - what clients **pay professional service firms** for the discrete artifact delivery.

**Why This Matters:**
- An NDA represents **years of accumulated R&D costs** ($100M-$500M per Gemini)
- But the **discrete regulatory filing work** might be $3M-$8M (per my research)
- Both are "correct" - they're measuring different things

✗ Less sophisticated sourcing documentation
✗ Video production positioning inconsistent (Super Bowl commercial undervalued)

---

## 6. Valuation Reconciliation Analysis

### Case Study: New Drug Application (NDA)

**Gemini's View:**
- Value: $100M-$500M+
- Rationale: "Capitalized cost to produce the artifact, representing the culmination of years of R&D, clinical trial execution (which costs billions)"
- Includes: ALL preclinical work, ALL clinical trials, biostatistics, regulatory affairs, medical writing

**Claude's View:**
- Value: $3M-$8M
- Rationale: "Application fees + preparation" - the discrete regulatory submission work
- Includes: FDA application fee ($3.1M in 2021) + regulatory consulting + medical writing for the actual submission

**Reconciliation:**
Both are correct for different contexts:
- If you're a **pharma company CEO** asking "what did our NDA cost us?" → Gemini's number ($100M-$500M)
- If you're a **regulatory consultant** asking "what can I bill for NDA preparation?" → Claude's number ($3M-$8M)

**Similar reconciliation applies to:**
- Clinical trials (Gemini: total execution cost vs. Claude: CRO project fees)
- Software architecture (Gemini: includes build vs. Claude: design phase only)
- Restructuring plans (Gemini: all professional fees vs. Claude: advisory subset)

---

## 7. Combined Insights & Synthesis

### What We Learn From BOTH Reports:

**1. Value Concentration**
- Both agree: Top 10 artifacts vastly outweigh the bottom 90
- Pharmaceutical/medical artifacts dominate ultra-high-value tier (consensus)
- Financial services (M&A, IPO, restructuring) are consistently high-value

**2. 2020 as Inflection Point**
- Both identify 2020 as a unique year with pandemic-driven bifurcation
- Digital transformation artifacts saw historic demand increases
- Traditional physical/in-person artifacts declined

**3. Regulatory Gatekeeping Creates Value**
- Both reports show that **regulatory requirement = high value**
- FDA submissions, SEC filings, bankruptcy court plans are all non-discretionary
- "Permission artifacts" command premium pricing

**4. The "Plan vs. Execution" Pattern**
- Gemini explicitly articulated this: "The artifact's value is a fraction of the downstream capital spend"
- Architecture/engineering designs are valuable because they guide billion-dollar builds
- Strategic plans are valuable because they direct multi-year transformations

### The Ultimate Insight:

**There are TWO valid "2020 Human Artifact Indices":**

**Index A: Total Economic Value (Gemini approach)**
- Measures what society invested in creating these artifacts
- Useful for understanding R&D economics, capital formation, and total knowledge work value
- Top artifacts: NDA, Infrastructure Design, Clinical Trials

**Index B: Professional Services Market Value (Claude approach)**
- Measures what clients pay for discrete professional services
- Useful for benchmarking consulting fees, understanding service pricing, hiring decisions
- Top artifacts: Clinical Trial Execution, M&A Advisory, Consulting Engagements

**Neither is "wrong" - they answer different questions.**

## 8. Recommendations for Future Research

### Methodology Best Practices (from both approaches):

**From Gemini:**
1. ✓ Use the "Data Scarcity Protocol" - be explicit when using proxy years
2. ✓ Assign confidence levels to estimates
3. ✓ Use court filings and public records when available (bankruptcy, SEC filings)
4. ✓ Create detailed profiles for top-tier artifacts
5. ✓ Develop a clear valuation definition and stick to it

**From Claude:**
1. ✓ Provide consistent detail across all items
2. ✓ Use tiered organization for clarity
3. ✓ Document methodology transparently
4. ✓ Cover granular mid-tier artifacts thoroughly
5. ✓ Make research reproducible with clear sources

### How to Improve BOTH Reports:

**Critical Addition:**
- **Major Infrastructure Engineering Design** should be in Claude's top 10
- **More granular artifact profiles** (31-100) in Gemini's report

**Methodological Clarity:**
- Be explicit upfront: "This index measures [production cost / billing value / market price]"
- Consider creating TWO separate rankings if measuring both

**Better 2020 Specificity:**
- More primary sources from 2020 (both reports struggled here)
- Interview professionals who worked on 2020 projects
- Use 2020 annual reports and 10-K filings more extensively

**Sector Balance:**
- Both could improve coverage of:
  - Government/defense contracting artifacts
  - Healthcare IT (separate from pharma)
  - Insurance/actuarial artifacts
  - Academic research outputs
