  Research Objective

  Create "The 2020 Human Artifact Index" - a comprehensive, ranked catalog of the 100 most economically valuable
  artifact types that professional teams created in calendar year 2020. This research aims to map the landscape of
  high-value professional deliverables across industries before widespread AI disruption.

  Definition and Scope

  Artifact Type: A category of professional deliverable or output created by specialized teams as their primary work
   product. Examples include:
  - Corporate Due Diligence Reports (Big 4, investment banks, law firms for M&A - typical value: $500K-$1.5M+)
  - Clinical Trial Protocols (medical researchers/CRAs for pharma - typical value: $100K-$500K+)
  - Patent Applications (patent attorneys - typical value: $10K-$50K+)
  - Environmental Impact Statements (engineering consultancies - typical value: $100K-$1M+)

  Inclusion Criteria:
  - Professional B2B or institutional deliverables (not consumer products)
  - Created by teams with specialized expertise
  - Has measurable economic value/billing amount
  - Was actively produced in calendar year 2020
  - Represents a distinct artifact type (not too granular, not too broad)

  Exclusion Criteria:
  - Physical products or manufactured goods
  - Consumer-facing services
  - Internal corporate documents without external billing value
  - Ongoing services without discrete deliverable milestones

  Key Research Questions

  1. What are the 100 highest-value artifact types that professional services firms, consultancies, and specialized
  teams created in 2020?
  2. What was the typical billing range or economic value for each artifact type in 2020, specifically?
  3. Which teams, firms, or professional categories typically produced each artifact type?
  4. What industries or clients typically commissioned these artifacts?
  5. How did COVID-19 impact the creation volume or pricing of certain artifact types in 2020?
  6. What are concrete real-world examples or use cases for each artifact type?
  7. How is economic value distributed across different professional sectors (finance, legal, medical, engineering,
  etc.)?

  - Note COVID-19 pandemic impacts on artifact production and pricing

  Geographic Scope:

  Value Measurement:
  - Use typical/median project value, not outliers
  - Provide value ranges (e.g., $100K-$500K) when single numbers aren't representative
  - Consider both direct billing and total economic value to client
  - Prefer documented market rates over theoretical estimates

  Ranking Methodology:
  - Rank by typical economic value per artifact instance
  - Use midpoint of range for ranking when exact values unavailable
  - Consider frequency of production as tiebreaker for similar values

  This requires a comprehensive deep-dive with rigorous sourcing. For each of the 100 artifact types, provide:

  1. Artifact Name: Clear, professional terminology used in the industry
  2. Detailed Description: 2-3 sentences explaining what the artifact is, what it contains, and its purpose
  3. Economic Value in 2020:
    - Typical billing range or project value
    - Cite specific sources (industry reports, professional service firm data, regulatory filings, market research)
    - Note if COVID-19 affected pricing
  4. Producer Teams/Firms:
    - Types of firms that create this artifact (e.g., "Big 4 accounting firms, boutique M&A advisors")
