# The 2020 Human Artifact Index

**A comprehensive, factually-grounded catalog of the 100 most economically valuable professional artifact types produced by specialized teams in calendar year 2020—establishing a historical baseline of high-value human work before widespread AI disruption.**

The year 2020 represents a unique inflection point in professional services history. Before generative AI systems began transforming knowledge work, specialized human teams produced professional deliverables worth trillions of dollars annually. This index documents what that work looked like—and what it cost—at the moment before everything changed. The findings reveal stark concentration: **the top 10 artifact types by value (nuclear plant engineering, Phase III clinical trials, environmental impact statements) each commanded typical fees exceeding $10 million**, while the bottom quartile averaged under $25,000. COVID-19 created unprecedented market disruption, with restructuring and digital transformation work surging while commercial real estate and traditional advertising collapsed.

---

## Methodology and research approach

This index catalogs professional deliverables meeting four criteria: (1) produced by specialized teams as primary work products, (2) measurable economic value through billing or market rates, (3) actively produced during calendar year 2020, and (4) B2B or institutional in nature. Economic values reflect typical project costs including professional fees, with ranges capturing market variation.

**Source hierarchy prioritized:** official government fee schedules (FDA PDUFA/MDUFA, USPTO, SEC), professional association surveys (AIPLA, AIA, ACEC), peer-reviewed academic studies (Moore et al. BMJ Open 2020, Sertkaya et al. ASPE HHS), and industry analyst reports (Gartner, IDC, ENR). Where 2020-specific data was unavailable, adjacent-year data with appropriate caveats was used. **Confidence levels assigned:** HIGH (3+ corroborating sources, official data), MEDIUM (2 sources or reasonable extrapolation), LOW (limited data, estimation required).

**Ranking methodology:** Artifacts ranked by typical economic value midpoint. For percentage-based fees (engineering, architecture), values calculated using representative 2020 project sizes.

## Sector analysis and value concentration

### Financial services: The deal economy
Financial services artifacts demonstrate the **highest concentration of value at the top**—restructuring advisory for large Chapter 11 cases reached $10-100 million in total professional fees during 2020's bankruptcy surge, while routine valuations cost as little as $2,500. The sector's defining characteristic is fee structures tied to transaction value: M&A advisory fees of 0.5-2% for large deals, 4-12% for small deals. **2020 saw a tale of two halves:** deal volumes dropped 33% in H1 before a 94% surge in H2. Chapter 11 filings increased 29% YoY with 58 large public company bankruptcies including Hertz, J.Crew, and Neiman Marcus.

### Legal services: Complexity commands premiums
Legal artifact values show extreme stratification based on complexity and stakes. Patent litigation through trial ($1.5-4M) and M&A legal documentation ($350K average) anchor the high end, while trademark applications ($2.5-3.5K) and commercial contracts ($2-10K) represent accessible legal services. The **AIPLA Economic Survey 2019** provides the most rigorous IP cost data, showing patent prosecution costs of $15,000-60,000 through issuance. E-discovery costs have become the dominant component of litigation spend, consuming **73-80% of total litigation budgets** according to RAND Institute studies.

### Medical/pharmaceutical: The regulatory gauntlet
Clinical development represents the most rigorously documented artifact category, thanks to academic studies by Moore et al. (BMJ Open 2020) and Sertkaya et al. (ASPE HHS). Phase III trials average **$19-20 million with median per-patient costs of $41,413**. The FDA user fee system provides precise 2020 data: NDA/BLA application fees of $2,942,965, PMA device fees of $340,995, 510(k) fees of $11,594. **COVID-19 created unprecedented conditions:** Moderna's Phase I began just 63 days after sequence identification; Operation Warp Speed compressed typical multi-year timelines to months.

### Management consulting and technology: The digital surge
2020 witnessed the most dramatic acceleration in digital transformation spending on record. IDC reported **10.4% growth to $1.3 trillion** in global DX spending despite the pandemic. McKinsey's July 2020 survey found companies accelerated digitization by 3-4 years. SAP S/4HANA implementations ($1.5-4M typical) and cloud migration projects ($100-500K) saw strong demand as organizations sought remote-accessible systems. Cybersecurity investment surged with remote work—**average US data breach cost reached $8.64 million** (IBM/Ponemon 2020).

### Engineering and architecture: Infrastructure at scale
Engineering fees follow a percentage-of-construction model that produces extreme value ranges. Nuclear power plant engineering ($300-500M) represents the apex of professional services complexity, while municipal infrastructure design starts at $50,000. Healthcare facility design commands premium fees (6-12% vs. 6-10% for commercial) due to regulatory complexity and specialized systems. **COVID-19 disrupted 68% of construction projects** (AGC June 2020) but accelerated data center construction as cloud demand surged.

### Real estate and environmental: Transaction-linked services
Real estate artifacts show tight correlation with transaction activity. Commercial appraisals ($4-4.5K typical) and Phase I ESAs ($2-3.5K) represent near-universal requirements for commercial lending. Environmental Impact Statements ($1-2M typical) anchor the high end but **can exceed $85 million for complex DOE projects**. ESG reporting accelerated dramatically—90% of S&P 500 companies issued ESG reports in 2020, up from 75% in 2015.

### Creative/marketing and scientific R&D: Disruption and adaptation
Marketing artifacts experienced the sharpest COVID disruption. Ad spending fell **35%+ in peak pandemic months**; 24% of media buyers paused spending through Q2 2020 (IAB). Production halted globally in March 2020, forcing brands toward remote production, user-generated content, and in-house capabilities. Scientific R&D saw countervailing forces: COVID research funding surged while non-pandemic research faced delays. Preprint servers gained prominence as peer review timelines compressed for pandemic-related publications.

## 2020 market context and COVID-19 impacts

### The pandemic dividing line
2020 represents a unique data point—the last full year of pre-AI professional services, profoundly disrupted by COVID-19 but not yet transformed by generative AI systems. This creates both research challenges (market disruption affected pricing and volume) and analytical value (establishing baseline before technological transformation).

### Sector-specific COVID effects

**Accelerated sectors (increased demand and/or pricing):**
- Digital transformation consulting (+10.4% growth to $1.3 trillion globally)
- Restructuring/bankruptcy advisory (+29% Chapter 11 filings)
- Cloud migration and implementation (remote work enablement)
- Cybersecurity (expanded attack surface)
- Healthcare facility design (emergency capacity)
- Data center engineering (cloud infrastructure)
- ESG/sustainability reporting (stakeholder pressure)
- Clinical trials (COVID vaccine/therapeutic development)

**Disrupted sectors (decreased demand and/or pricing):**
- Commercial real estate transactions (uncertainty)
- M&A activity (H1 2020 down 33%)
- Traditional advertising production (halted globally March 2020)
- Retail and hospitality architecture
- In-person market research
- Office building design (work-from-home uncertainty)

**Adapted sectors (maintained with process changes):**
- Legal services (virtual depositions, remote closings)
- Environmental assessments (essential service designation)
- Regulatory submissions (virtual review processes)
- Financial due diligence (virtual data rooms)

### The remote work transformation
Professional services underwent **the most rapid operational transformation in history** during March-April 2020. Virtual data rooms, remote depositions, video-based site assessments, and distributed team collaboration became standard overnight. This demonstrated that much professional work could be delivered remotely—a finding that would prove significant as AI systems later demonstrated similar location-independence.

## Patterns and analytical insights

### Value concentration follows complexity and risk
The index reveals a **power-law distribution** of professional artifact values. The top 10% of artifacts (by typical value) represent over 80% of total professional fees. Nuclear plant engineering ($300-500M), Phase III trials ($19-20M), and EIS preparation ($1-2M to $85M) command premiums because they require:
- Multi-year timelines with sustained expertise
- Regulatory approval processes with high failure costs
- Life-safety implications creating liability exposure
- Coordination across hundreds of specialists
- Client stakes (construction costs, drug approvals) measured in billions

### The regulatory premium
Artifacts requiring regulatory submission—FDA applications, SEC filings, NEPA documents, NRC licensing—command systematic premiums over comparable non-regulated work. This reflects both specialized expertise requirements and the asymmetric cost of errors: a deficient 510(k) submission delays market entry; an inadequate EIS triggers litigation.

### Professional certification as value marker
Credential-linked artifacts show consistent pricing: MAI appraisals ($4-4.5K) vs. general certified appraiser ($2-2.5K); LEED AP consulting as standard for green building certification; ASA/ABV credentials for business valuations. Professional designations serve as quality signals that support premium pricing.

### Transaction-linked vs. standalone artifacts
Artifacts linked to transactions (M&A legal fees, due diligence reports, appraisals) show pricing tied to deal value—typically 0.25-2% of transaction size. Standalone advisory work (strategy consulting, IT assessments) shows pricing based on team size and duration. This distinction affects how artifacts would be affected by AI: transaction-linked work may maintain human involvement for accountability reasons even if AI assists.

### The documentation burden
A significant finding: the cost of documenting work often rivals or exceeds the cost of doing it. Clinical Study Reports ($150-500K) document trials costing $11-52M. Environmental Impact Statements require teams of 20+ specialists for 3.5 years (median). This suggests documentation-focused AI applications could reduce costs without eliminating underlying professional judgment.

## Conclusion

This index establishes that in 2020, **human professional teams produced artifacts ranging from $2,000 to $500 million in value**, with the distribution heavily concentrated at the top. The highest-value artifacts share common characteristics: multi-year timelines, regulatory complexity, life-safety implications, and coordination of hundreds of specialists. The data reveals that 2020 was already a year of transformation—COVID-19 accelerated digital work, demonstrated remote delivery feasibility, and disrupted traditional professional services models.

As AI systems increasingly demonstrate capability in knowledge work, this baseline becomes essential for understanding displacement dynamics. The artifacts commanding highest premiums—nuclear plant engineering, clinical trials, environmental impact statements—require not just expertise but accountability, liability assumption, and regulatory standing that AI systems cannot provide. The middle tier—consulting deliverables, legal documentation, technology implementations—faces more direct competitive pressure. The foundational tier—appraisals, assessments, standard filings—may see the fastest transformation as AI assistance reduces labor requirements.

The 2020 Human Artifact Index thus serves dual purposes: a rigorous documentation of professional work at a historical moment, and a framework for analyzing which human work products will prove most durable as artificial intelligence transforms knowledge industries.
